# Heap Sort Visualizer

An interactive visualization tool for Min Heap and Max Heap sorting algorithms, developed using Python and Streamlit. This project allows users to understand the mechanics of heap-based sorting through dynamic bar chart animations and binary tree representations.

---

## Features

- **Min Heap and Max Heap Sort** implementation
- Real-time **bar graph visualization** with animated swaps
- Parallel **binary heap tree rendering** using NetworkX
- Node color highlights for active comparisons and swaps
- **Speed control** (0.5x to 1.75x) for educational pacing
- Option to input arrays manually or generate them randomly
- Tracks and displays **number of comparisons and swaps**

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python** â€“ Core language
- **Streamlit** â€“ UI and interactive components
- **Matplotlib** â€“ Bar chart visualizations
- **NetworkX** â€“ Heap tree structure rendering
- **NumPy** â€“ Efficient number and array operations
